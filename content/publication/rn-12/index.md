abstract: Sea ice can serve as a temporary sink for microplastics (MPs), and thus, it too can function as a secondary source of and transport medium for MPs. This study aimed to explore the effect of various MP properties and environmental characteristics on the entrainment and enrichment of MPs in ice under varying turbulence conditions. It was found that high rotation speed in freshwater distinctively enhanced the entrainment of hydrophobic MPs in ice, this being attributable to the combined effects of frazil ice and air bubbles. The hydrophobic nature of these MPs caused them to be attracted to the water/air or water/ice interface. However, in saline water, high turbulence inhibited the entrainment of all of the MP types under study. The ice crystals formed a loose structure in saline water instead of congealing, and this allowed the exchange of MPs between ice and water, leading to the rapid expulsion of MPs from the ice. The enrichment factors of all the MPs under study increased in calm saline water compared to in calm freshwater. The results revealed that the entrainment and enrichment of MPs in ice can be critical pathways affecting their fate in cold regions.
