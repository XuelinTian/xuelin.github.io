abstract: Oil spills in the marine environment frequently reach the coastal zone where active cleanup strategies may become necessary if the rates of natural weathering and attenuation of the stranded oil are considered inadequate. The application of surface-washing agents (SWAs) is an operational technique that enhances the separation and removal of oil that is adhered to solid surfaces. This article presents a comprehensive review of the current and emerging technologies to treat oiled shorelines using SWAs. The discussion includes a brief description of the characteristics of shoreline oiling and the current available techniques for shoreline treatment or cleanup. It summarizes the basics of surface washing, toxicity issues associate with SWAs, and state-of-the-art efforts to date on oil removal using SWAs at both laboratory and field scales. The development trends of green SWAs for shoreline treatment are further introduced. Finally, a new perspective on challenges and recommendations is provided for future research on the applicability and effectiveness of SWAs oiled shorelines.
