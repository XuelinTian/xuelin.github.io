## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in environmental engineering at the Department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering at Concordia University. My research focuses on the decarbonization of transportation through electrification, the low-carbon transition of urban energy systems, and the assessment and optimization of greenhouse gas reduction strategies. I also have expertise in data mining and predictive analytics, utilizing life cycle thinking, statistical models and machine learning/deep learning techniques to advance sustainable and resilient transportation systems.
