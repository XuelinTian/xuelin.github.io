##üéâ Exciting News! üéâ

I am thrilled to announce that my recently published article has been awarded a prestigious scholarship, Rel√®ve √©toile Louis-Berlinguet F√©vrierthe by Fonds de recherche du Qu√©bec!
Award-Winning Publication:
**Entrainment and Enrichment of Microplastics in Ice Formation Processes: Implications for the Transport of Microplastics in Cold Regions
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c09340

**Published in: ACS Publications

**Summary:
In recent years, the term ‚Äúmicroplastics‚Äù has gained significant attention. These tiny plastic particles, some invisible to the naked eye, have been found everywhere‚Äîfrom the depths of our oceans to the tops of mountains. But what happens to these particles in cold, icy regions like Quebec?

Our study delves into this question, especially given the high levels of microplastics found in Arctic ice samples. We discovered that sea ice formation can trap microplastics much like a spider web catches insects. However, when the ice melts due to seasonal changes or rising global temperatures, these trapped plastics could be released back into the water.

Several factors influence how microplastics become trapped in ice, including the nature of the water (fresh or salt) and its movement. Under certain conditions, microplastics are more easily captured during the freezing process. Interestingly, some plastics, due to their hydrophobicity, are more likely to get stuck at air/water or ice/water interfaces.

In the context of climate change, as global temperatures rise and ice melts at unprecedented rates, the release of trapped microplastics back into the environment is concerning. This can harm marine wildlife and potentially enter our food supply. Our study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing this issue, paving the way for methods to reduce the impact of microplastics in sensitive cold ecosystems.

Thank you for your continued support! üåç‚ùÑÔ∏è
